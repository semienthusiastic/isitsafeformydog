## Are Cashews Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary pet-nutrition sources including the American Kennel Club and PetMD describe **cashews as non-toxic to dogs**. They are not listed among nuts known to cause poisoning, such as macadamia nuts.

Despite this, cashews are consistently discussed as a **food of concern** rather than a safe or beneficial food. Veterinary literature highlights their fat content and the way they are commonly prepared as the primary issues.

As a result, cashews are generally placed in a caution category.

## Why Cashews Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Main factors of concern
- **High fat content**, which veterinary sources associate with digestive upset and pancreatitis risk.  
- **Added salt**, commonly present in packaged cashews and noted as an additional concern.

### Portion size and dog size
Veterinary articles note that tolerance varies between individual dogs, but high-fat snack foods are broadly described as difficult for dogs to digest.

### Preparation differences
Veterinary sources distinguish between **plain, unsalted cashews** and roasted or seasoned varieties, with added ingredients increasing the likelihood of problems.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Cashews

Veterinary sources commonly associate fatty or salty foods with:

- Diarrhoea  
- Vomiting  
- Abdominal discomfort  

### More serious signs
- Pancreatitis, discussed in veterinary literature in relation to high-fat foods

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Salt** (frequently present in roasted cashews)  
- ❌ **Seasonings or flavour coatings** (may include onion or garlic powders, which are toxic to dogs)  
- ⚠️ **Oils used in roasting** (which may add additional fat)

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources indicate that **puppies may have more sensitive digestive systems**. Fat- and salt-related concerns apply to both puppies and adult dogs.

## Other Common Variants of Cashews

### Raw Cashews
Veterinary references note that cashews sold for consumption are typically heat-treated, but raw cashews are still discussed in terms of fat content rather than toxicity.

### Roasted Cashews
Roasted varieties are more often associated with added salt or oils.

### Cashew Products
Cashew-based spreads or products may contain added sugar, salt, or flavourings that raise additional concerns.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

- Plain vegetables such as carrots  
- Plain fruit without seeds or pits  
- Commercial dog treats formulated for canine diets
