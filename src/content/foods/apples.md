# Safe in Moderation
Apple is a healthy, low-calorie treat for dogs when prepared properly. It provides natural sweetness, vitamins, and fiber, but **the core and seeds must be removed** due to the presence of cyanogenic compounds.

## Benefits
* **Vitamins A & C:** Support skin, coat, and immune health.
* **Dietary Fiber:** Aids digestion and helps keep dogs feeling satisfied.
* **Low Fat:** A great crunchy alternative to processed treats.

*Tip: Slice apples into small pieces and serve fresh or freeze them for a cooling snack.*
