## Is Rosemary Safe for Dogs?

According to veterinary and pet-safety sources including the ASPCA, the American Kennel Club, and PetMD, **rosemary is considered safe for dogs**. It is listed by the ASPCA as a non-toxic plant for pets.

Veterinary literature generally treats rosemary as a benign culinary herb, with attention focused on quantity and form rather than toxicity.

## Why Rosemary Is Generally Considered Safe

### Non-toxic herb
Veterinary toxicology references do not identify rosemary as containing compounds that are poisonous to dogs.

### Common culinary use
Pet-nutrition sources frequently mention rosemary as a herb that may appear in small amounts in foods without posing a toxic risk.

### Recognised plant safety status
The ASPCA explicitly lists rosemary as non-toxic to dogs, cats, and horses.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Rosemary

Veterinary sources indicate that adverse reactions are uncommon but may include:

- Mild stomach upset  
- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  

These effects are typically associated with **larger quantities** rather than normal incidental exposure.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

Veterinary sources distinguish plain rosemary from concentrated or mixed products:

- ❌ **Rosemary essential oil** — highly concentrated and discussed separately from the plant  
- ❌ **Seasoned foods containing rosemary** — may also include garlic or onion, which are toxic to dogs  
- ⚠️ **Dried rosemary in large amounts** — more concentrated than fresh leaves  

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary nutrition sources do not identify rosemary as an age-specific hazard. Digestive sensitivity may vary, but rosemary itself is not listed as unsafe for puppies or adult dogs.

## Other Common Variants of Rosemary

### Fresh rosemary
Veterinary literature treats fresh rosemary as the standard reference point for plant safety.

### Dried rosemary
Pet-nutrition sources note dried rosemary as more concentrated but not toxic.

### Rosemary extract or oil
Veterinary sources discuss extracts and essential oils separately due to higher concentration levels.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Safety Sources

Veterinary and pet-nutrition articles commonly reference the following herbs as examples discussed in canine diets:

- Basil  
- Parsley  
- Thyme
