## Is Red Cabbage Safe for Dogs?

According to veterinary and pet-nutrition sources including the American Kennel Club and PetMD, **red cabbage is considered safe for dogs**. These sources do not list cabbage as toxic and discuss it as a non-poisonous vegetable.

Veterinary literature typically addresses cabbage as a group, noting similar considerations across green, red, and savoy varieties.

## Why Red Cabbage Is Generally Considered Safe

### Non-toxic vegetable
Veterinary toxicology references do not identify red cabbage as containing compounds that are poisonous to dogs.

### Naturally occurring plant compounds
Pet-nutrition articles note that cabbage contains **isothiocyanates** and other sulfur-containing compounds, which are associated with odor and gas rather than toxicity.

### Similar treatment across cabbage types
Veterinary sources generally discuss red cabbage alongside other cabbage varieties, with no separate toxicity classification.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Red Cabbage

Veterinary and pet-nutrition sources describe occasional digestive effects, which may include:

- Gas or bloating  
- Loose stools  
- Mild stomach discomfort  

These effects are typically attributed to digestive sensitivity rather than poisoning.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

Veterinary sources distinguish plain cabbage from prepared dishes:

- ❌ **Salt or seasonings** — commonly added during cooking  
- ❌ **Butter or oils** — increase fat content  
- ❌ **Onion or garlic** — often included in cabbage dishes and classified as toxic to dogs  
- ⚠️ **Pickled red cabbage** — high salt and vinegar content  

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary nutrition sources do not identify red cabbage as an age-specific risk. Digestive sensitivity may vary by individual dog, but red cabbage itself is not listed as unsafe for puppies or adult dogs.

## Other Common Variants of Cabbage

### Raw red cabbage
Veterinary literature discusses raw cabbage primarily in relation to gas production and digestibility.

### Cooked red cabbage
Pet-nutrition sources treat cooked cabbage similarly, noting that preparation affects digestibility more than safety.

### Fermented or pickled cabbage
Veterinary sources classify these as different foods due to salt, vinegar, and fermentation byproducts.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

Veterinary and pet-nutrition articles commonly reference the following vegetables as examples discussed in canine diets:

- Carrots  
- Green beans  
- Cucumbers
