# Use Caution
While the flesh of an avocado contains lower levels of **persin** (a fungicidal toxin) than the skin or leaves, it can still cause stomach upset in some dogs. The primary danger, however, is the **pit**.

## Risks
* **Choking Hazard:** The large pit can easily block a dog's throat or intestinal tract, requiring surgery.
* **High Fat Content:** Avocados are fatty, which can trigger pancreatitis in sensitive dogs.
* **Persin Toxicity:** High amounts (found mostly in the skin and leaves) can cause vomiting and diarrhea.

**Verdict:** It is safer to avoid giving avocado to your dog. If they eat a small piece of the flesh, they will likely be fine, but watch for vomiting.
