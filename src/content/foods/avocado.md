# Risky
Avocados contain a fungicidal toxin called **persin**. While dogs are more resistant to persin than other animals (like birds or horses), it can still cause vomiting and diarrhea in high amounts.

## The Real Danger: The Pit
The large stone (pit) inside the avocado represents a massive choking hazard. If swallowed, it can easily block the dog's intestines, requiring emergency surgery.

**Verdict:** It is safer to avoid giving avocado to your dog.
