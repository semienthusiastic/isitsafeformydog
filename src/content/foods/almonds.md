# Use Caution
While almonds are not toxic (like Macadamia nuts), they are not a good treat for dogs.

## The Risks
*   **Choking:** Almonds are hard and the perfect shape to block a windpipe or esophagus, especially in small breeds.
*   **Digestion:** Dogs do not digest nuts well. Eating almonds often leads to gastric distress (vomiting/diarrhea).
*   **Pancreatitis:** The high fat content can trigger inflammation of the pancreas.
*   **Seasoning:** Salted or flavored almonds cause dehydration.

**Verdict:** If your dog eats one, they will likely be fine, but do not offer them intentionally.
