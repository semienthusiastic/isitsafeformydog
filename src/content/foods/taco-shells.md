## Are Taco Shells Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary and pet-nutrition sources generally classify **taco shells as non-toxic but potentially problematic** for dogs. While the base ingredients (corn or flour) are not listed as toxic, taco shells are **highly processed grain products**.

The AKC and PetMD discuss tortilla chips and similar products as foods that may cause digestive upset due to salt and fat content. VCA Hospitals similarly notes that many people foods, particularly processed snacks, are not well suited to canine digestion.
