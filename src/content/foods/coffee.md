# Highly Toxic
Coffee (and tea) contains **caffeine**, a stimulant that is very dangerous for dogs. Dogs are much more sensitive to caffeine than humans.

## Risks
The danger depends on the form ingested:
*   **Liquid Coffee:** Dangerous, but often diluted.
*   **Coffee Grounds/Beans:** **EXTREME DANGER.** A small amount of grounds or beans contains a highly concentrated dose of caffeine that can be fatal for small dogs.

## Symptoms
*   Hyperactivity and restlessness
*   Vomiting
*   Elevated heart rate (tachycardia)
*   Tremors and seizures
*   Collapse

**Action:** If your dog eats coffee grounds or beans, go to the vet immediately.
