## Is Tea Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary toxicology sources consistently classify **tea as unsafe for dogs**. The primary concern is **caffeine**, which is listed by the ASPCA and Pet Poison Helpline as toxic to dogs. Tea is specifically mentioned alongside coffee and energy drinks as a common caffeine source.

Both brewed tea and dry tea leaves are discussed in veterinary literature as potential poisoning risks.

## Why Tea Is Dangerous for Dogs

### Main substance of concern

- **Caffeine**, identified by veterinary toxicology organisations as toxic to dogs  

Caffeine affects the nervous system and cardiovascular system in dogs. Veterinary sources note that dogs are significantly more sensitive to caffeine than humans.

### Brewed tea vs. tea leaves

Veterinary resources highlight that **tea leaves and tea bags may contain concentrated caffeine**, posing an additional risk if ingested. Brewed tea also contains caffeine and is not considered safe.

### Different types of tea

Black, green, white, and matcha teas are all discussed as unsafe due to caffeine content. Herbal teas are addressed separately in veterinary literature depending on ingredients.

## Signs Reported With Tea or Caffeine Exposure

Veterinary toxicology sources list the following signs associated with caffeine ingestion in dogs:

- Restlessness or agitation  
- Rapid heart rate  
- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  

### More serious signs

- Tremors  
- Seizures  
- Collapse  

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Caffeine**, the primary toxic concern  
- ❌ **Tea leaves or tea bags**, which may contain concentrated caffeine  
- ⚠️ **Added sweeteners or flavourings**, sometimes present in bottled teas  

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources note that **puppies and smaller dogs are at greater risk** of caffeine toxicity due to lower body weight. However, caffeine is toxic to dogs of all ages.

## Other Common Tea Variants

### Iced tea

Veterinary articles classify iced tea similarly to hot tea due to caffeine content and, in some cases, added sugar.

### Herbal teas

Herbal teas are discussed separately in veterinary literature. Some may not contain caffeine, but safety depends on the specific herbs used.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Care Sources

- Plain water  
- Veterinary-formulated hydration products  
- Moisture from balanced commercial dog food
