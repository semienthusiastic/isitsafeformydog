## Is Soda Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary toxicology sources consistently classify **soda as unsafe for dogs**. The primary concern highlighted by organisations such as the ASPCA and Pet Poison Helpline is **caffeine**, which is listed as toxic to dogs and is present in many soft drinks.

Even when caffeine is not present, veterinary sources note that soda still contains **high sugar levels and carbonation**, which are not discussed as appropriate for dogs in pet-health literature.

### Main substances of concern

- **Caffeine**, listed by veterinary toxicology organisations as toxic to dogs  
- **High sugar content**, frequently noted in pet-care articles as a digestive concern

### Caffeine toxicity

According to the ASPCA and Pet Poison Helpline, caffeine can affect a dog’s nervous system and heart. Soda is specifically mentioned alongside coffee, tea, and energy drinks as a source of caffeine exposure.

### Preparation and product differences

Colas and energy-style soft drinks are more commonly referenced due to caffeine content. Even caffeine-free sodas are discussed cautiously because of sugar and carbonation.
