# Safe (In Small Amounts)
Cinnamon is non-toxic to dogs. A sprinkle on their food or in homemade dog treats is generally safe and smells great.

## What to Avoid
*   **Cinnamon Sticks:** These can cause choking or perforate the mouth/intestines if chewed.
*   **Essential Oils:** Cinnamon oil is highly concentrated and can cause skin irritation or liver issues.
*   **Nutmeg:** Often paired with cinnamon, **Nutmeg is TOXIC.** Ensure you aren't using a pre-mixed "Pumpkin Spice" blend that contains nutmeg.
*   **Inhalation:** Inhaling loose powder can irritate a dog's lungs and cause coughing.

**Verdict:** Safe to bake into treats, but don't let them eat the stick.
