# Highly Toxic
All parts of the onion plant are toxic to dogs, whether raw, cooked, fried, or powdered. Onions contain **N-propyl disulfide**, a compound that breaks down red blood cells, leading to anemia.

## Symptoms
* Pale gums
* Lethargy and weakness
* Fainting
* Reddish urine
* Vomiting

**Note:** Garlic is even more potent than onions. If your dog eats a significant amount of either, contact your vet.
