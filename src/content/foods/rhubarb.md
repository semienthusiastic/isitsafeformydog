## Is Rhubarb Safe for Dogs?

According to veterinary toxicology and pet-safety sources including the ASPCA, the American Kennel Club, and PetMD, **rhubarb is toxic to dogs**. Rhubarb is consistently listed among plants that pose a poisoning risk to pets.

Veterinary literature places particular emphasis on **rhubarb leaves**, which contain higher concentrations of harmful compounds, but the plant as a whole is classified as unsafe.

## Why Rhubarb Is Dangerous for Dogs

### Oxalates
Veterinary toxicology sources identify **soluble oxalates** in rhubarb as the primary toxic compounds. These substances can interfere with calcium balance and irritate the digestive tract.

### Leaf toxicity
Pet-safety organisations consistently state that **rhubarb leaves** contain especially high oxalate levels and are the most dangerous part of the plant.

### Systemic effects
Veterinary literature notes that oxalate exposure can affect multiple body systems, extending beyond simple digestive upset.

## Signs Reported When Dogs Are Exposed to Rhubarb

Veterinary sources list the following signs:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Drooling  
- Lethargy  

### More serious signs
- Tremors  
- Weakness  
- Irregular heart rhythm  
- Signs related to kidney involvement, as described in toxicology references  

## Parts of Rhubarb of Particular Concern

Veterinary and pet-safety sources highlight the following:

- ❌ **Rhubarb leaves** — very high oxalate content  
- ❌ **Rhubarb plant (stalks, leaves, roots)** — classified as toxic  
- ❌ **Garden-grown rhubarb** — same toxicity profile as culinary rhubarb  

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary toxicology sources indicate that **both puppies and adult dogs are at risk** from rhubarb exposure. Smaller dogs and puppies may experience more severe effects from lower amounts due to body size.

## Other Common Rhubarb-Containing Items

### Rhubarb desserts
Veterinary sources note that baked goods containing rhubarb remain unsafe due to the presence of rhubarb itself.

### Garden plants
Pet-safety organisations frequently highlight ornamental or garden rhubarb as a common source of exposure.

### Rhubarb preserves
Veterinary literature treats preserves similarly, as processing does not remove oxalates.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Safety Sources

Veterinary and pet-nutrition articles commonly reference the following fruits and vegetables as examples discussed in canine diets:

- Apples (without seeds)  
- Blueberries  
- Carrots  

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

> *This FAQ summarises themes appearing in veterinary toxicology and pet-safety literature.  
> It is informational only and not a substitute for professional veterinary care.*

### Is rhubarb toxic to dogs?
Yes. Veterinary sources consistently classify rhubarb as toxic, particularly due to oxalates in the leaves.

### Are rhubarb stalks safer than leaves?
Pet-safety sources note that leaves are more toxic, but the entire plant is classified as unsafe for dogs.

### Is cooked rhubarb safe?
Veterinary literature states that cooking does not eliminate oxalates, so rhubarb remains unsafe.
