## Is Vanilla Extract Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary toxicology sources consistently classify **vanilla extract as unsafe for dogs**. The primary concern is its **high alcohol content**, which is listed by the ASPCA and Pet Poison Helpline as toxic to dogs.

Pure vanilla extract typically contains a significant percentage of alcohol, making it fundamentally different from vanilla-flavoured foods or products that do not contain alcohol.

## Why Vanilla Extract Is Dangerous for Dogs

### Main substance of concern

- **Alcohol (ethanol)**, identified by veterinary toxicology organisations as toxic to dogs  

Alcohol affects the nervous system and can cause serious systemic effects in dogs, even in relatively small amounts.

### Concentration concerns

Veterinary sources highlight that vanilla extract is **highly concentrated**, meaning even small quantities contain a significant amount of alcohol compared with many other foods.

### Product differences

Pure vanilla extract is discussed differently from **imitation vanilla flavouring**, which may contain less or no alcohol but can include other additives. Veterinary sources still caution against both due to formulation and concentration.

## Signs Reported With Alcohol Exposure in Dogs

Veterinary toxicology sources list the following signs associated with alcohol ingestion:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Lethargy  
- Disorientation  

### More serious signs

- Tremors  
- Difficulty breathing  
- Low body temperature  
- Seizures  
- Collapse  

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Alcohol**, the primary toxic concern  
- ⚠️ **Other flavouring agents**, depending on formulation  

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources note that **puppies and smaller dogs are at greater risk** of alcohol poisoning due to lower body weight. However, alcohol is toxic to dogs of all ages.

## Other Common Vanilla Products

### Vanilla-flavoured baked goods

Veterinary articles discuss baked goods separately, noting that alcohol may evaporate during baking, but **other ingredients** such as sugar, butter, chocolate, or artificial sweeteners may pose additional concerns.

### Imitation vanilla flavouring

Imitation vanilla may contain less alcohol, but veterinary sources still discuss these products cautiously due to additives and lack of nutritional value for dogs.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Care Sources

- Plain water  
- Balanced commercial dog foods  
- Veterinary-formulated dog treats
