# Safe, BUT Check the Label
Peanut butter is a favorite treat for many dogs and is generally safe and healthy. **However**, some sugar-free brands contain **Xylitol** (often labeled as Birch Sugar), which is highly toxic.

## The Xylitol Danger
If the peanut butter contains Xylitol, it can cause a sudden release of insulin, leading to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), seizures, and liver failure within minutes.

## Safe Usage
* **Check ingredients:** Ensure it contains only peanuts and maybe salt/sugar.
* **Moderation:** It is high in fat, so too much can cause pancreatitis.
