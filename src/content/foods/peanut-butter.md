# Safe (Check the Label!)
Peanut butter is a favorite treat for many dogs. It is an excellent source of protein, healthy fats, and vitamins B and E. It is often used to hide pills or fill puzzle toys.

## ⚠️ Critical Warning: Xylitol
Some "sugar-free" or "low-calorie" peanut butters contain **Xylitol** (sometimes listed as **Birch Sugar**). Xylitol is extremely toxic to dogs and can cause liver failure. **ALWAYS check the ingredients list before giving peanut butter to your dog.**

## Safe Consumption
* Stick to unsalted, natural peanut butter.
* Moderation is key due to high fat content (too much can cause pancreatitis).
