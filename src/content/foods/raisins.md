## Are Raisins Safe for Dogs?

According to major veterinary toxicology and pet-safety organisations, **raisins are toxic to dogs**. Raisins are consistently grouped with grapes in veterinary literature and are widely recognised as a serious poisoning risk.

Veterinary sources emphasise that **no safe amount of raisins has been identified**. Some dogs develop severe illness after ingesting only a small quantity, while others may appear unaffected, making exposure unpredictable.

## Why Raisins Are Dangerous for Dogs

### Kidney toxicity
Veterinary toxicology sources report that raisins can cause **acute kidney failure** in dogs. The exact toxic compound has not been definitively identified, but the association with kidney injury is well established.

### Unpredictable sensitivity
Pet-safety organisations note that dogs vary widely in their response to raisins. This variability means that even small or accidental exposures are treated as medical emergencies.

### Concentrated form of grapes
Veterinary literature highlights that raisins are **dried grapes**, which concentrates whatever toxic component is responsible for kidney damage.

## Signs Reported When Dogs Are Exposed to Raisins

Veterinary sources list the following early signs:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Loss of appetite  
- Lethargy  

### More serious signs
- Decreased or absent urine production  
- Abdominal pain  
- Tremors  
- Signs of acute kidney failure  

## Ingredients or Additives of Particular Concern

Veterinary sources consistently state that **raisins themselves are the primary hazard**, regardless of preparation:

- ❌ **Plain raisins** — toxic  
- ❌ **Baked goods containing raisins** — toxic due to raisin content  
- ❌ **Trail mixes or cereals with raisins** — toxic  
- ❌ **Organic or natural raisins** — equally toxic  

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary toxicology sources indicate that **both puppies and adult dogs are at risk** from raisin ingestion. Body size does not reliably predict severity, and kidney damage has been reported across all ages and breeds.

## Other Common Variants of Raisins

### Sultanas
Veterinary sources classify sultanas the same as raisins, noting identical toxicity concerns.

### Currants
Pet-safety organisations include currants alongside raisins and grapes as toxic to dogs.

### Raisin-containing foods
Veterinary literature treats any food containing raisins as unsafe due to the same kidney risks.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Safety Sources

Veterinary and pet-nutrition articles commonly reference the following fruits as examples discussed in canine diets:

- Apples (without seeds)  
- Blueberries  
- Strawberries
