## Is Cilantro Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary pet-nutrition sources including the American Kennel Club and PetMD describe **cilantro as non-toxic to dogs**. It is not listed among foods or plants associated with poisoning or systemic toxicity.

However, cilantro is commonly placed in a **caution category**. Veterinary literature notes that while the herb itself is safe, dogs may react negatively to its taste or plant compounds, leading to mild digestive issues.

Across authoritative sources, individual tolerance is highlighted as the main factor.

## Why Cilantro Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Main factors of concern
- **Strong flavour and aroma**, which veterinary sources note some dogs find unappealing.  
- **Plant compounds**, which may contribute to mild gastrointestinal irritation in sensitive dogs.

### Portion size and dog size
Veterinary articles indicate that tolerance varies between dogs, and reactions are more likely when larger amounts are consumed.

### Preparation differences
Veterinary sources distinguish between **plain fresh cilantro** and cilantro used in seasoned dishes, where added ingredients may raise separate concerns.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Cilantro

Veterinary sources commonly associate herb intolerance with:

- Diarrhoea  
- Vomiting  
- Reduced appetite  

### More serious signs
- Persistent gastrointestinal upset in sensitive dogs

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Garlic or onion** (often paired with cilantro in dishes; classified as toxic to dogs)  
- ❌ **Salt or spices** (may increase digestive irritation)  
- ⚠️ **Sauces or dressings** containing cilantro (often include unsuitable ingredients)

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources indicate that **puppies may have more sensitive digestive systems**, but cilantro-related concerns apply to dogs of all ages.

## Other Common Variants of Cilantro

### Fresh Cilantro
Veterinary references describe fresh cilantro as non-toxic when eaten alone.

### Dried Cilantro
Drying does not introduce toxicity, but flavour concentration may still cause aversion.

### Cilantro in Prepared Foods
Veterinary sources note that prepared foods containing cilantro raise additional concerns due to other ingredients.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

- Plain carrots  
- Green beans
