## Is Italian Seasoning Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary toxicology authorities consistently classify **Italian seasoning as unsafe for dogs**. Italian seasoning is not a single herb, but a blended spice mix typically used in cooking.

According to veterinary sources, the primary concern is that most Italian seasoning blends **contain garlic, onion, or both**, either as powders or granules. The ASPCA and Pet Poison Helpline list garlic and onion as toxic to dogs in all forms. The AKC confirms that cooking or drying does not reduce this toxicity.

As a result, Italian seasoning is treated as a **toxic food** due to its typical ingredient composition.

## Why Italian Seasoning Is Dangerous for Dogs

### Garlic and onion content
Veterinary toxicology sources identify garlic and onion as members of the *Allium* family. These plants contain sulfur-based compounds that damage red blood cells in dogs and can lead to haemolytic anaemia.

### Concentrated powdered form
Seasonings often use dried or powdered garlic and onion, which veterinary sources note are **more concentrated by weight** than fresh forms.

### Mixed ingredient risk
Because Italian seasoning is a blend, ingredient lists vary, making it difficult to ensure the absence of toxic components.

## Signs Reported in Garlic or Onion Toxicity

Veterinary organisations report the following signs associated with ingestion of garlic- or onion-containing foods:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Lethargy  
- Weakness  

### More serious signs
- Pale gums  
- Rapid heart rate  
- Collapse  
- Signs consistent with anaemia  

Symptoms may be delayed and can appear days after ingestion.

## Ingredients or Additives of Particular Concern

Italian seasoning blends commonly include:

- ❌ **Garlic powder** (toxic to dogs)  
- ❌ **Onion powder** (toxic to dogs)  
- ⚠️ **Salt**, sometimes added to commercial blends  
- ⚠️ **Other strong herbs**, which may cause digestive irritation  

The presence of garlic or onion is the defining toxic factor.

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary toxicology sources state that **garlic and onion toxicity affects dogs of all ages**. Puppies may be more vulnerable due to smaller body size, but adult dogs are also at risk.

## Individual Herbs vs. Seasoning Blends

### Single herbs
Some individual herbs used in Italian seasoning, such as basil or oregano, are discussed separately in veterinary literature and are not inherently toxic.

### Mixed seasoning blends
Veterinary sources emphasise that **blends are higher risk** because they frequently include garlic or onion.

## Allium Ingredients Classified as Toxic

Veterinary and pet-safety organisations consistently list the following as toxic to dogs:

- Garlic  
- Onions  
- Shallots  
- Leeks  
- Chives  

Italian seasoning commonly contains one or more of these in powdered form.
