## Is Mayonnaise Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary and pet-nutrition organisations generally classify **mayonnaise as non-toxic to dogs**, meaning it is not listed as a poison by veterinary toxicology authorities.

However, mayonnaise is consistently described as a **food requiring caution**. The AKC and PetMD explain that mayonnaise is a high-fat, calorie-dense condiment designed for human diets and offers no nutritional benefit for dogs.

Across veterinary guidance, concerns focus on **fat content, calories, and ingredient variations**, not inherent toxicity.

## Why Mayonnaise Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Very high fat content
Pet-nutrition sources note that mayonnaise is primarily made from oil and egg yolks, resulting in a high fat concentration that may cause digestive upset.

### Calorie density
Veterinary articles highlight that calorie-dense foods can disrupt normal dietary balance and contribute to gastrointestinal discomfort.

### Ingredient variation
Flavoured or reduced-fat mayonnaise products may contain additional ingredients that change the safety profile.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Mayonnaise

Veterinary sources describe the following signs associated with high-fat foods:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Abdominal discomfort  
- Lethargy  

These signs are generally linked to fat intake rather than toxicity.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

Mayonnaise products may contain ingredients that veterinary organisations flag as concerning:

- ⚠️ **High oil and fat levels**, inherent to mayonnaise  
- ⚠️ **Salt**, commonly added for flavour  
- ❌ **Garlic or onion**, sometimes included in flavoured varieties and classified as toxic  
- ⚠️ **Spices or flavourings**, which may irritate digestion  

Risk depends on the specific formulation.

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary literature notes that **puppies may be more sensitive** to rich, high-fat foods due to immature digestive systems. Adult dogs may also experience digestive upset depending on individual tolerance.

## Other Condiments Discussed in Veterinary Sources

### Salad dressings
Often discussed with caution due to fat, sugar, and seasoning.

### Aioli
Treated as higher risk because it typically contains garlic.

### Flavoured spreads
Veterinary sources note similar concerns related to additives.

## Condiments Mentioned in Pet-Safety Literature

Veterinary and pet-safety organisations frequently reference:

- Mayonnaise  
- Salad dressings  
- Sauces  
- Spreads  

Discussions consistently focus on fat content and added ingredients.
