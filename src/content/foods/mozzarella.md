## Is Mozzarella Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary and pet-nutrition organisations generally classify **mozzarella as non-toxic to dogs**. It is not listed as poisonous by veterinary toxicology authorities.

However, mozzarella is consistently described as a **food requiring caution**. The AKC and PetMD explain that cheese is a dairy product, and many dogs have difficulty digesting lactose. VCA Hospitals notes that lactose intolerance is common in dogs, particularly after weaning.

Across veterinary guidance, concerns focus on **digestion, fat content, and individual tolerance**, not toxicity.

## Why Mozzarella Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Lactose content
Veterinary sources explain that mozzarella contains lactose, which may cause gastrointestinal upset in lactose-intolerant dogs.

### Fat levels
Pet-nutrition articles note that mozzarella contains fat, which may contribute to vomiting or diarrhoea in some dogs.

### Salt content
Veterinary guidance highlights sodium as a concern in cheeses, particularly when consumed in larger quantities.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Mozzarella

Veterinary sources describe the following signs associated with dairy intolerance:

- Diarrhoea  
- Vomiting  
- Gas  
- Abdominal discomfort  

These effects are linked to digestion rather than poisoning.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

Mozzarella products may vary significantly in formulation:

- ⚠️ **High-fat versions**, which may worsen digestive upset  
- ⚠️ **Added salt**, common in processed mozzarella  
- ❌ **Seasoned or flavoured mozzarella**, which may contain garlic or onion  

Concerns depend on processing and added ingredients rather than the cheese itself.

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary literature notes that **puppies may digest lactose more easily** than adult dogs, but this tolerance often decreases with age. Adult dogs are more likely to experience lactose intolerance.

## Other Cheeses Discussed in Veterinary Sources

### Cheddar
Often discussed with similar lactose and fat considerations.

### Goat cheese
Veterinary sources note differences in lactose content but still discuss digestive sensitivity.

### Cream cheese
Discussed as higher risk due to fat content.

## Dairy Foods Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Literature

Veterinary and pet-nutrition articles frequently reference these dairy products:

- Mozzarella  
- Cheddar  
- Yogurt  
- Milk  

Discussions consistently focus on lactose intolerance and fat content rather than toxicity.
