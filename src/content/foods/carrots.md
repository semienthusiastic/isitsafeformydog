# Safe and Healthy
Carrots are an excellent snack for dogs. They are low in calories and high in fiber and beta-carotene (which produces Vitamin A).

## Benefits
* **Dental Health:** Crunching on raw carrots can help remove plaque from teeth.
* **Low Fat:** Great for dogs on a diet.
* **Vitamins:** High in Vitamin A.

*Tip: Cut them into bite-sized chunks to prevent choking.*
