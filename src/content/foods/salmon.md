## Is Salmon Safe for Dogs?

According to the AKC, **plain, cooked salmon is safe for dogs** and is often included in commercial dog foods because it is a source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids.

However, veterinary organisations caution strongly against feeding **raw salmon**. VCA Hospitals explains that raw salmon may carry *Neorickettsia helminthoeca*, a bacterium transmitted by a parasitic fluke that can cause salmon poisoning disease in dogs.

The FDA warns that raw fish can contain harmful pathogens and parasites, and therefore should not be given to pets.

## Why Salmon Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Main considerations
- **Parasites and bacteria in raw salmon**: Can cause salmon poisoning disease, a condition that may be severe if untreated.  
- **High fat content**: Rich or oily cuts may contribute to digestive upset.  
- **Seasonings**: Garlic, onion, salt, or butter are common in cooked salmon dishes and may be unsuitable for dogs.

### Portion size and dog size
Because salmon is calorie-dense, smaller dogs may be more sensitive to portions containing added fat or oils.

### Preparation differences
Veterinary sources distinguish between:
- **Cooked salmon, plain** (generally safe)  
- **Raw salmon** (unsafe due to parasites and bacteria)  
- **Smoked or canned salmon** (may contain excess salt or seasonings)

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Salmon

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Lethargy  

### More serious signs (associated with salmon poisoning disease)
- Fever  
- Swollen lymph nodes  
- Dehydration  
- Joint pain  

These signs typically appear several days after consuming infected raw salmon, according to VCA Hospitals.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Garlic or onion seasonings** (classified as toxic by ASPCA/APCC)  
- ❌ **High sodium levels** (common in smoked or canned salmon)  
- ⚠️ **Excess oils or butter** (may contribute to digestive upset)

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources do not classify cooked salmon differently for puppies and adult dogs. However, puppies may be more sensitive to rich or oily foods, and raw salmon poses equal or greater risk to dogs of all ages.

## Other Common Variants of Salmon

### Raw Salmon
Considered **unsafe** due to the risk of parasites and bacteria.

### Canned Salmon
Generally safe if plain and low in sodium, but many canned products contain added salt or seasonings.

### Smoked Salmon
Often high in salt and therefore not recommended.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

- Plain cooked chicken  
- Plain cooked turkey  
- Plain cooked white fish  
- Commercial dog treats
