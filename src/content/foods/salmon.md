# Safe (Must Be Cooked)
Salmon is one of the best fish for dogs. It is rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, which support the immune system, reduce inflammation, and keep the coat shiny.

## The Danger of Raw Salmon
**NEVER feed raw or undercooked salmon.** 
Raw salmon can contain the *Neorickettsia helminthoeca* parasite, which causes **Salmon Poisoning Disease**. This condition is fatal if untreated. 

## Best Way to Serve
*   **Fully Cooked:** Steam, grill, or bake it without oil, salt, garlic, or onions.
*   **Boneless:** Ensure all small bones are removed to prevent choking.
*   **Canned:** Canned salmon (in water, not oil) is safe and convenient.

**Verdict:** A superfood for dogs, provided it is fully cooked.
