# Highly Toxic
Chocolate contains **theobromine** and **caffeine**. Dogs cannot metabolize these compounds effectively, leading to a buildup that affects the heart, central nervous system, and kidneys.

## Toxicity Levels
The darker the chocolate, the more dangerous it is:
1.  **Cocoa Powder / Baker's Chocolate:** Most Toxic.
2.  **Dark Chocolate:** Highly Toxic.
3.  **Milk Chocolate:** Toxic in larger amounts.
4.  **White Chocolate:** Low toxicity (mostly sugar/fat), but still unhealthy.

## Symptoms
* Vomiting and diarrhea
* Rapid breathing and panting
* Increased heart rate
* Seizures

**Action:** If your dog ingests chocolate, call your vet immediately. Have the wrapper ready to tell them the type of chocolate and how much was eaten.
