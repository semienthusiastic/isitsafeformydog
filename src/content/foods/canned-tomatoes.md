## Are Canned Tomatoes Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary pet-care sources including the American Kennel Club and PetMD explain that **ripe tomato flesh is not classified as toxic to dogs**. When tomatoes are fully ripe, the compounds associated with toxicity are present at much lower levels.

Canned tomatoes, however, are discussed with greater caution. Veterinary literature consistently points to **added sodium and processing** as the main concerns with canned tomato products. In addition, the ASPCA notes that parts of the tomato plant and unripe tomatoes contain substances that are toxic to dogs.

For these reasons, canned tomatoes are generally placed in a caution category.

## Why Canned Tomatoes Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Main factors of concern
- **Added salt**, commonly present in canned tomatoes and noted as a concern in veterinary nutrition sources.  
- **Tomatine**, a compound found in higher concentrations in unripe tomatoes and plant parts, which the ASPCA classifies as toxic to dogs.

### Portion size and dog size
Veterinary articles note that tolerance varies between individual dogs, but processed foods with added salt are broadly described as more likely to cause issues than plain foods.

### Preparation differences
Veterinary sources distinguish between **fresh, ripe tomatoes** and canned tomato products, with processing and added ingredients being the primary difference.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Tomatoes

Veterinary sources commonly associate tomato-related problems with:

- Diarrhoea  
- Vomiting  
- Abdominal discomfort  

### More serious signs
- Weakness or tremors, associated in toxicology references with ingestion of unripe tomatoes or plant material

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Added salt** (frequently present in canned tomatoes)  
- ❌ **Onion or garlic** (often included in canned tomato products; classified as toxic to dogs)  
- ⚠️ **Herbs or seasonings** (which may irritate the digestive tract)

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources indicate that **puppies may be more sensitive** to digestive upset and toxic exposures. Concerns related to unripe tomatoes, plant material, and salt apply to both puppies and adult dogs.

## Other Common Variants of Tomatoes

### Fresh Ripe Tomatoes
Veterinary pet-care articles generally describe ripe tomato flesh as non-toxic when stems and leaves are removed.

### Unripe Tomatoes
Veterinary toxicology sources associate green or unripe tomatoes with higher levels of tomatine and increased risk.

### Tomato-Based Products
Veterinary references note that sauces and canned products may contain added salt, sugar, or onion-based ingredients that raise additional concerns.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

- Plain carrots  
- Green beans  
- Plain pumpkin
