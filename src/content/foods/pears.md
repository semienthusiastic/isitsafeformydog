## Are Pears Safe for Dogs?

According to veterinary and pet-safety sources including the American Kennel Club, the ASPCA, and PetMD, **pears are not inherently toxic to dogs** when only the flesh is considered. These sources consistently distinguish between the edible fruit and other parts of the pear.

Veterinary literature identifies the **seeds and core** as the primary concerns. These parts are discussed as hazardous due to both chemical and physical risks.

## Why Pears Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Seeds and core
Veterinary toxicology sources note that pear seeds contain **cyanogenic compounds**, which are listed as toxic to dogs if ingested. The core may also present a physical obstruction risk.

### Choking and obstruction risk
Pet-safety articles frequently highlight the **size and firmness of pear cores** as potential choking or gastrointestinal blockage hazards.

### Sugar content
Veterinary nutrition sources mention that pear flesh contains **natural sugars**, which may contribute to digestive upset in some dogs.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Pears

Veterinary sources list the following signs associated with seed ingestion or digestive sensitivity:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Abdominal discomfort  

### More serious signs
- Choking  
- Gastrointestinal blockage  
- Signs associated with cyanide exposure, as discussed in toxicology references  

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

Veterinary sources distinguish fresh pears from pear-containing products:

- ❌ **Pear seeds and cores** — contain cyanogenic compounds and pose a physical hazard  
- ❌ **Canned pears in syrup** — often contain added sugars  
- ⚠️ **Preserved or flavored pear products** — may include additives or sweeteners  

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources note that **puppies and smaller dogs** may be at higher risk of choking or obstruction due to the size of pear cores. The chemical and physical risks associated with seeds apply to dogs of all ages.

## Other Common Variants of Pears

### Fresh pears
Veterinary literature discusses fresh pears primarily in relation to removal of seeds and cores.

### Canned pears
Pet-nutrition sources highlight canned pears as a concern due to added sugars and syrups.

### Pear-flavored foods
Veterinary sources note that pear-flavored products often contain sugar or artificial additives rather than whole fruit.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

Veterinary and pet-nutrition articles commonly reference the following fruits as examples discussed in canine diets:

- Apples (without seeds)  
- Blueberries  
- Strawberries
