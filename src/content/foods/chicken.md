# Safe (Cooked & Boneless)
Chicken is a staple of many dog diets and is often recommended by vets as a "bland diet" (boiled chicken and rice) for dogs with upset stomachs. It is an excellent source of lean protein and Omega-6 fatty acids.

## ⚠️ Important Safety Warnings
*   **NEVER feed cooked bones:** Cooked chicken bones become brittle and can splinter, causing fatal punctures to the stomach or intestines.
*   **Avoid Seasoning:** Garlic, onions, and excessive salt are toxic or unhealthy. Stick to plain, boiled, or roasted chicken.
*   **Raw Risks:** The AVMA discourages feeding raw chicken due to the high risk of *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter* infections for both the dog and the human handling the food.

**Verdict:** Boneless, skinless, cooked chicken is one of the safest "human foods" you can share.
