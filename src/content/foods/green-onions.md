## Are Green Onions Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary toxicology authorities consistently classify **green onions as toxic to dogs**. Green onions, also known as scallions or spring onions, are members of the *Allium* family, which includes onions, garlic, leeks, and chives.

The ASPCA and Pet Poison Helpline list onions in all forms as poisonous to dogs. The AKC explicitly includes green onions in this classification, noting that they pose the same risks as other onion varieties.

Across veterinary references, green onions are not considered safe in any form.

## Why Green Onions Are Dangerous for Dogs

### Toxic compounds
Veterinary toxicology sources identify **thiosulfates and related sulfur-containing compounds** in onions as the cause of toxicity. These compounds damage red blood cells in dogs.

### Effect of cooking or drying
Pet Poison Helpline and the AKC state that **cooking, drying, or chopping green onions does not reduce their toxicity**. Raw and cooked forms are treated the same in veterinary guidance.

### Cumulative exposure
Veterinary sources note that onion toxicity can occur after a single larger exposure or from repeated smaller exposures over time.

## Signs Reported in Green Onion Toxicity

Veterinary organisations report the following signs associated with onion ingestion:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Lethargy  
- Weakness  

### More serious signs
- Pale gums  
- Rapid heart rate  
- Collapse  
- Signs consistent with haemolytic anaemia  

Symptoms may be delayed and can appear several days after ingestion.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

Green onions commonly appear in foods discussed in veterinary warnings:

- ❌ **Seasoning blends and garnishes**, often added after cooking  
- ❌ **Soups, sauces, and stir-fries**, where green onions may be mixed in  
- ❌ **Dehydrated green onion flakes or powders**, which remain toxic  

Veterinary sources treat all forms as unsafe.

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary toxicology sources state that **green onion toxicity affects dogs of all ages**. Puppies may be more vulnerable due to smaller body size, but adult dogs are also at risk.

## Other Onion-Based Foods Classified as Toxic

### Cooked onions
Cooking does not make onions safe, according to veterinary sources.

### Onion powder
Veterinary organisations highlight powdered forms as particularly dangerous due to concentration.

### Leeks and chives
These *Allium* relatives are also listed as toxic.

## Allium Plants Listed as Toxic

Veterinary and pet-safety organisations consistently include:

- Green onions (scallions)  
- Onions  
- Garlic  
- Leeks  
- Chives  
- Shallots  

All are classified as toxic to dogs.
