## Is Tahini Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary and pet-nutrition sources generally classify **tahini as non-toxic but potentially problematic** for dogs. Tahini is a paste made from ground sesame seeds, and while sesame seeds themselves are not listed as toxic, veterinary sources focus on **fat content and processing** when discussing seed-based products.

The AKC and PetMD both explain that sesame seeds are not toxic to dogs. VCA Hospitals similarly notes that nuts and seeds may cause digestive upset depending on form and preparation.

## Why Tahini Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Main concerns noted by veterinary sources

- **High fat content**, concentrated due to grinding seeds into a paste  
- **Added salt**, present in some commercial tahini products  
- **Digestive sensitivity**, particularly with rich or unfamiliar foods  

### Portion size and dog size

Veterinary articles note that **smaller dogs may be more sensitive** to high-fat foods due to body size. Digestive reactions, however, can occur in dogs of any size.

### Preparation differences

Veterinary sources distinguish **plain tahini** from flavoured or seasoned sesame pastes. Products containing garlic, lemon, or spices raise additional concerns beyond the sesame content itself.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Tahini

Veterinary and pet-care resources commonly associate tahini-related reactions with digestive signs, including:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Abdominal discomfort  

### Less commonly discussed concerns

- Weight gain when high-fat foods are consumed frequently  
- Pancreatic irritation associated with rich foods  

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Added salt**, commonly present in packaged tahini  
- ❌ **Garlic or spices**, sometimes included in flavoured tahini or related spreads  
- ⚠️ **High fat levels**, inherent to sesame seed paste  

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources generally indicate that **puppies may be more sensitive** to rich or fatty foods due to developing digestive systems. However, fat-related concerns apply to dogs of all ages.

## Other Common Sesame-Based Products

### Sesame seeds

Veterinary sources classify plain sesame seeds as non-toxic, but still note digestive concerns depending on quantity and preparation.

### Hummus and sesame spreads

Prepared foods containing tahini are discussed cautiously due to **additional ingredients**, such as garlic, salt, and oils.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

- Plain cooked vegetables  
- Commercial dog treats formulated with seeds  
- Veterinary-formulated dog foods
