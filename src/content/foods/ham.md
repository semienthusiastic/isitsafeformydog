# Use Caution
While ham is not toxic (poisonous) to dogs, it is not a healthy treat. Most store-bought ham is loaded with sodium and preservatives (nitrates) that are hard for dogs to process.

## Why avoid it?
*   **High Sodium:** Too much salt can cause excessive thirst, urination, and in severe cases, sodium ion poisoning.
*   **High Fat:** Fatty meats can trigger **pancreatitis**, a painful and potentially life-threatening inflammation of the pancreas.
*   **Seasonings:** Honey-baked or glazed hams often contain sugar and spices that upset a dog's digestion.

**Verdict:** A tiny piece dropped on the floor won't hurt, but do not feed ham as a regular treat.
