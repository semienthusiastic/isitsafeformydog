## Is Arugula Safe for Dogs?

According to the AKC, **arugula is safe for dogs** and is not classified as toxic by veterinary organisations. It is sometimes mentioned as a leafy green that dogs can eat when served plain and without added ingredients.

PetMD similarly reports that arugula is not poisonous to dogs. The article notes that while arugula contains beneficial nutrients for humans, dogs do not require it nutritionally and may react to its peppery flavour.

Across veterinary nutrition references, arugula is generally considered **low risk** when plain and unseasoned.

## Why Arugula Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Main considerations
- **Strong, peppery flavour**: May cause refusal or mild stomach upset in some dogs.  
- **Fibre content**: Higher fibre may lead to gas or loose stools if eaten in larger amounts.  

### Portion size and dog size
Smaller dogs may be more affected by fibre intake because even small amounts represent a larger proportion of their overall diet.

### Preparation differences
Veterinary sources distinguish between:
- **Plain arugula leaves** (generally safe)  
- **Cooked or seasoned arugula** (may contain oils, garlic, or salt)  
- **Arugula mixed into salads** (often includes unsafe ingredients)

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Arugula

- Gas  
- Soft stools  
- Mild diarrhoea  

These signs are typically related to digestive sensitivity rather than toxicity.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Garlic or onion** (commonly used in salads and classified as toxic to dogs)  
- ❌ **Salad dressings** (may contain oil, vinegar, salt, or sweeteners)  
- ⚠️ **Spices or seasoning blends** (may irritate the digestive system)

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources do not classify arugula differently for puppies and adult dogs. However, puppies may be more sensitive to dietary changes due to their developing digestive systems.

## Other Common Variants of Arugula

### Baby Arugula
Softer texture and generally easier to chew; still considered safe when plain.

### Cooked Arugula
Not toxic, but often prepared with oils or seasonings that may be unsuitable.

### Arugula Salad Mixes
Often combined with ingredients that veterinary organisations classify as unsafe for dogs.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

- Carrot sticks  
- Green beans  
- Cooked pumpkin  
- Commercial dog treats
