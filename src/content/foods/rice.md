# Safe (Great for Upset Stomachs)
Rice is a safe carbohydrate source and is often recommended by veterinarians as part of a "bland diet" for dogs recovering from diarrhea or vomiting.

## White vs. Brown Rice
*   **White Rice:** The husk is removed, making it very easy to digest. This is the best choice for a sick dog.
*   **Brown Rice:** Higher in protein and fiber, but harder to digest. Good for healthy dogs, but skip it if your dog has tummy trouble.

## Preparation
Boil the rice in plain water. Do not add butter, salt, or spices.

**Verdict:** A pantry staple that serves as excellent medicine for digestive issues.
