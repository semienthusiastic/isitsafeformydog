## Are Nectarines Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary and pet-nutrition organisations generally classify **nectarine flesh as non-toxic to dogs**. Nectarines are not listed as poisonous by veterinary toxicology authorities when only the soft fruit flesh is considered.

However, nectarines are consistently discussed as a **food requiring caution**. The AKC and PetMD explain that the pit creates a significant safety risk. The ASPCA also notes that fruit pits and seeds can contain compounds that are unsafe and can cause physical harm.

Across veterinary guidance, the primary concern is **the pit**, not the fruit flesh itself.

## Why Nectarines Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Pit hazards
Veterinary sources explain that nectarine pits are hard and large, posing a choking risk and a potential cause of gastrointestinal obstruction.

### Cyanogenic compounds
Pet-safety references note that pits from stone fruits contain cyanogenic glycosides, which can release cyanide when chewed or broken.

### Sugar content
Veterinary nutrition articles note that nectarines contain natural sugars, which may contribute to digestive upset in some dogs.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Nectarines

Veterinary sources describe the following signs:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Abdominal discomfort  

### More serious signs
- Choking  
- Intestinal blockage  
- Lethargy  

Severe signs are generally linked to pit ingestion rather than fruit flesh.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

Concerns related to nectarines focus on form rather than preparation:

- ❌ **Nectarine pits**, which pose choking and toxicity risks  
- ⚠️ **Fruit skins**, which may be difficult to digest for some dogs  
- ⚠️ **Sugary fruit mixtures**, which increase overall sugar intake  

The pit is the primary safety concern.

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary literature notes that **puppies may be at higher risk** due to smaller size and a greater likelihood of choking or obstruction. Adult dogs are also vulnerable to pit-related hazards.

## Other Stone Fruits Discussed in Veterinary Sources

### Peaches
Discussed with identical pit-related concerns.

### Plums
Veterinary sources note similar risks related to pits and cyanogenic compounds.

### Apricots
Also discussed with caution due to pit hazards.

## Fruits Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Literature

Veterinary and pet-nutrition articles frequently reference these fruits when discussing pits and digestion:

- Nectarines  
- Peaches  
- Plums  
- Cherries  

Discussions consistently focus on physical hazards and pits rather than flesh toxicity.
