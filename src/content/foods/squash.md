## Is Squash Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary and pet-nutrition sources generally classify **squash as safe for dogs**. It is not listed as toxic by major veterinary toxicology organisations and is frequently included in articles discussing vegetables that dogs can tolerate.

The AKC and PetMD both reference squash as a non-toxic vegetable. VCA Hospitals similarly includes squash in its general guidance on vegetables that may be suitable for dogs when prepared without added ingredients.
