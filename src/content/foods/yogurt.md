## Is Yogurt Safe for Dogs?

According to the AKC, **plain yogurt is generally safe for dogs**, especially varieties without added sugar or artificial sweeteners. It is sometimes used because it contains live cultures and is typically lower in lactose than milk.

VCA Hospitals explains that many dogs experience **lactose intolerance**, which may lead to digestive upset when consuming dairy products, including yogurt.

The ASPCA notes that foods containing added sugars, flavourings, or sweeteners—especially xylitol—may pose risks for dogs.

## Why Yogurt Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Main considerations
- **Lactose intolerance**: Some dogs may have difficulty digesting yogurt due to its lactose content.  
- **Added sugars and flavourings**: Many commercial yogurts contain high sugar levels.  
- **Xylitol**: A toxic sweetener sometimes found in “sugar-free” yogurt.

### Portion size and dog size
Small dogs may be more sensitive to dairy-based digestive upset because of their size and lower capacity for lactose digestion.

### Preparation differences
Veterinary sources distinguish between:
- **Plain yogurt** (typically better tolerated)  
- **Flavoured yogurt** (may contain sugar or unsafe ingredients)  
- **Sugar-free yogurt** (may contain xylitol, which is toxic)

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Yogurt

- Gas  
- Diarrhoea  
- Bloating  

### More serious signs (associated with xylitol ingestion)
- Weakness  
- Tremors  
- Seizures  

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Xylitol** (highly toxic to dogs)  
- ❌ **Artificial sweeteners or added sugars**  
- ⚠️ **High-fat yogurt** (may cause digestive upset in sensitive dogs)

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Puppies may be more sensitive to lactose than adults because their digestive systems are still developing. Veterinary organisations note that tolerance varies widely, but caution is recommended with dairy products for all age groups.

## Other Common Variants of Yogurt

### Greek Yogurt
Often lower in lactose and thicker in texture; considered easier to digest for many dogs according to veterinary discussions.

### Flavoured Yogurt
Often contains sugar or flavourings that may be unsuitable for dogs.

### Sugar-Free Yogurt
May contain **xylitol**, which veterinary toxicology sources classify as dangerous.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

- Plain pumpkin purée  
- Mashed banana  
- Apple slices (seedless)  
- Commercial dog treats
