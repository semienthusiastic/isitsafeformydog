# Safe (Check the Label)
Yogurt is high in calcium and protein. It also acts as a probiotic, which can be good for your dog's digestive system.

## The Xylitol Danger
Many "low-fat" or "sugar-free" yogurts use artificial sweeteners. **Xylitol (or Birch Sugar)** is extremely toxic to dogs and causes rapid liver failure. **Always check the ingredients.**

## Best Choice
*   **Plain Greek Yogurt:** It has significantly less lactose than regular yogurt (making it easier to digest) and is thicker and protein-rich.
*   **Avoid:** Flavored yogurts (Vanilla, Strawberry, etc.) usually have too much added sugar for dogs.

**Verdict:** A healthy topper for kibble, provided it is plain and xylitol-free.
