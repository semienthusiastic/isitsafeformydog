## Are Hazelnuts Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary and pet-nutrition organisations generally explain that **hazelnuts are not toxic to dogs**. They are not listed as poisonous by veterinary toxicology authorities.

However, hazelnuts are consistently discussed as a **food requiring caution**. The AKC and PetMD note that whole nuts can present choking hazards and that the fat content of nuts may contribute to gastrointestinal upset in dogs.

Across veterinary guidance, the concerns surrounding hazelnuts relate to **physical form and nutritional composition**, not inherent toxicity.

## Why Hazelnuts Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Choking and obstruction risk
Veterinary sources explain that whole nuts may be difficult for dogs to chew properly, increasing the risk of choking or gastrointestinal obstruction.

### High fat content
Pet-nutrition articles highlight that hazelnuts are high in fat, which may lead to digestive upset in some dogs.

### Mold-related concerns
Veterinary references note that nuts can sometimes carry molds that produce toxins, although this is not specific to hazelnuts and depends on storage conditions.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Hazelnuts

Veterinary sources describe the following signs when dogs experience problems related to nuts:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Abdominal discomfort  
- Gagging or coughing (associated with choking)

More serious signs may occur if obstruction is involved.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

Hazelnuts are often found in products that introduce additional concerns:

- ❌ **Chocolate**, commonly paired with hazelnuts and classified as toxic to dogs  
- ⚠️ **Added salt**, present in roasted or flavoured nuts  
- ⚠️ **Sugars or coatings**, which may irritate digestion  

Concerns often arise from combined products rather than hazelnuts alone.

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary literature notes that **puppies may be at higher risk** of choking due to smaller airways. Digestive sensitivity to high-fat foods may also be more noticeable in younger dogs, though adult dogs can be affected as well.

## Other Nuts Discussed in Veterinary Sources

### Nuts classified as toxic
- Macadamia nuts

### Nuts discussed with caution
- Peanuts  
- Almonds  
- Hazelnuts  

Veterinary sources stress that nut safety varies widely by type.

## Nuts Commonly Mentioned in Pet-Safety Literature

Veterinary and pet-safety organisations frequently reference:

- Peanuts  
- Almonds  
- Walnuts  
- Hazelnuts  

Discussions consistently focus on choking, fat content, and added ingredients.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

> *This FAQ summarises themes appearing in veterinary and pet-nutrition articles.  
> It is informational only and not a substitute for professional veterinary care.*

### Are hazelnuts toxic to dogs?
Veterinary organisations do not classify hazelnuts as toxic. They are considered a food of concern due to choking and fat-related risks.

### Why are nuts treated differently from each other?
Pet-safety sources explain that toxicity varies by nut type, with some, such as macadamia nuts, being poisonous.

### Do roasted hazelnuts change the risk?
Veterinary guidance focuses on form and additives. Roasting does not remove choking risk and may add salt or fat.
