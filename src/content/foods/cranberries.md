## Are Cranberries Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary pet-nutrition sources including the American Kennel Club and PetMD describe **cranberries as non-toxic to dogs**. They are not listed among foods that cause chemical poisoning or systemic toxicity.

Despite this, cranberries are typically discussed with **caution**. Veterinary literature focuses on digestive tolerance, acidity, and sugar levels, particularly in processed cranberry products.
