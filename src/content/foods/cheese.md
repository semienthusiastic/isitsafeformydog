# Safe (In Moderation)
Cheese is a favorite for many dogs and works excellently as a "high value" reward during training or to hide medication pills.

## Best Options
*   **Cottage Cheese:** Low in fat and sodium; often the safest choice.
*   **Mozzarella:** Lower in salt than aged cheeses.
*   **Hard Cheeses (Cheddar/Swiss):** Lower in lactose than soft cheeses.

## Risks
*   **Lactose Intolerance:** Many dogs cannot digest milk sugars. If your dog gets gas or diarrhea after eating cheese, stop feeding it.
*   **Blue Cheese:** ⚠️ **Avoid.** The fungus used to make blue cheeses (like Roquefort) can produce *roquefortine C*, which is toxic to dogs.

**Verdict:** Safe for most dogs in small quantities.
