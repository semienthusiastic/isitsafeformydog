## Are Chives Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary pet-safety and toxicology sources including the ASPCA, the American Kennel Club, and PetMD consistently classify **chives as toxic to dogs**. Chives belong to the *Allium* family, which also includes onions, garlic, leeks, and shallots.

Allium plants contain sulfur-containing compounds that veterinary toxicology references associate with **damage to red blood cells**. Because of this mechanism, chives are not considered safe in any form.

Across authoritative veterinary sources, chives are treated as a toxic food rather than a food of concern.

## Why Chives Are Dangerous for Dogs

### Main compounds of concern
- **Organosulfoxides**, sulfur-containing compounds found in Allium plants that veterinary toxicology sources associate with oxidative damage to red blood cells.

### Mechanism of toxicity
Veterinary references explain that ingestion of Allium plants can lead to **hemolytic anemia**, a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced.

### Preparation differences
Veterinary sources consistently state that **raw, cooked, dried, or powdered chives** all pose a risk. Cooking or drying does not eliminate the toxic compounds.

## Signs Reported When Dogs Are Exposed to Chives

Veterinary toxicology sources list the following possible signs:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Abdominal discomfort  
- Lethargy  

### More serious signs
- Pale gums  
- Weakness  
- Elevated heart rate  
- Signs consistent with anemia

Symptoms may be delayed and can appear hours to days after ingestion.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Fresh chives**  
- ❌ **Dried or powdered chives** (often used as seasoning)  
- ❌ **Foods containing chives** (such as herb blends, dips, or garnishes)

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources indicate that **puppies may be at higher risk** due to smaller body size, but toxicity applies to dogs of all ages. Repeated or cumulative exposure is also noted as a concern in veterinary literature.

## Other Common Variants of Chives

### Fresh Chives
Veterinary sources classify fresh chives as toxic.

### Dried Chives
Drying concentrates compounds by weight and does not reduce toxicity.

### Chives in Prepared Foods
Veterinary references note that prepared foods containing chives still pose a risk due to Allium compounds.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

- Plain carrots  
- Green beans  
- Plain pumpkin
