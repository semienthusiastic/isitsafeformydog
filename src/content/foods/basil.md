## Is Basil Safe for Dogs?

According to the AKC, **basil is safe for dogs** and is not listed as toxic by veterinary organisations. Fresh basil leaves are generally considered low risk when eaten plain.

PetMD similarly reports that basil is non-toxic to dogs and is sometimes discussed as an herb that may be tolerated in small quantities. The article notes that dogs do not require herbs nutritionally, and reactions may vary.

Across veterinary nutrition references, basil is classified as **safe**, with most concerns related to preparation rather than the herb itself.

## Why Basil Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Main considerations
- **Digestive sensitivity**: Some dogs may experience mild stomach upset from herbs.  
- **Strong flavour**: The aroma and taste may not be well tolerated by all dogs.  
- **Preparation methods**: Basil is often served with oils, garlic, or salt.

### Portion size and dog size
Smaller dogs may be more affected by herbs because even small amounts represent a larger relative intake.

### Preparation differences
Veterinary sources distinguish between:
- **Fresh or dried basil** (plain and unseasoned; lower risk)  
- **Cooked basil dishes** (often include oil or garlic)  
- **Pesto or herb sauces** (contain ingredients unsuitable for dogs)

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Basil

- Mild diarrhoea  
- Vomiting  
- Gas  

These signs are generally mild and related to digestive sensitivity.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Garlic or onion** (commonly paired with basil and classified as toxic to dogs)  
- ❌ **Oils or butter** (high fat content)  
- ⚠️ **Salt or seasoning blends** (may irritate the digestive system)

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources do not classify basil differently for puppies and adult dogs. However, puppies may be more sensitive to dietary changes due to their developing digestive systems.

## Other Common Variants of Basil

### Dried Basil
Non-toxic and similar in safety profile to fresh basil when plain.

### Pesto
Contains garlic, oil, and sometimes nuts or cheese, which veterinary organisations classify as unsuitable for dogs.

### Basil-Infused Oils
High fat content and not evaluated as suitable for dogs.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

- Plain cooked vegetables  
- Carrot sticks  
- Green beans  
- Commercial dog treats
