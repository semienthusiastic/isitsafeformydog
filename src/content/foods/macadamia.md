# Toxic
Macadamia nuts are highly toxic to dogs. Ingestion can result in a specific syndrome characterized by weakness, especially in the hind legs.

## Symptoms
Symptoms usually appear within 12 hours of ingestion:
* **Weakness in back legs** (inability to stand)
* Vomiting
* Tremors and shaking
* Hyperthermia (high body temperature)

While rarely fatal, the symptoms can be frightening and painful for the dog. Veterinary supportive care is usually required to manage pain and nausea.
