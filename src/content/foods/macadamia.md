The Merck Veterinary Manual explains that macadamia nut toxicosis can lead to neurological and gastrointestinal signs, often appearing within 6–12 hours of ingestion.

## Why Macadamia Nuts Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Main compounds of concern
The exact toxic compound remains unidentified, but veterinary toxicologists consistently report that macadamia nuts cause:
- Weakness  
- Tremors  
- Gastrointestinal upset  

### Portion size and dog size
Toxicity has been reported even at **low doses**, and smaller dogs may be affected more severely due to lower body weight.

### Preparation differences
Veterinary organisations highlight that both:
- **Raw macadamia nuts**, and  
- **Roasted or seasoned macadamia nuts**  
are considered toxic.  

Products containing macadamia nuts (cookies, nut mixes, baked goods) may also contain chocolate or xylitol, which adds additional toxic risks.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Macadamia Nuts

- Vomiting  
- Weakness or lethargy  
- Tremors  
- Difficulty walking (ataxia)  

### More serious signs
- Elevated body temperature  
- Joint stiffness  
- Depression  

These clinical signs are widely documented in veterinary toxicology case reports.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Chocolate-covered macadamia nuts** (combine two serious toxins)  
- ❌ **Xylitol-containing baked goods** (highly toxic to dogs)  
- ⚠️ **Salted nuts** (excessive sodium may worsen symptoms)

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Macadamia nuts are toxic to **dogs of all ages**. Puppies may be at greater risk due to their smaller size, which may make even a single nut enough to cause illness.

## Other Common Variants of Macadamia Nuts

### Roasted or Salted Macadamia Nuts
Still toxic, with added concerns about high sodium levels.

### Macadamia Nut Cookies or Snacks
Often contain **chocolate**, **raisins**, or **xylitol**, all of which are also considered toxic by veterinary organisations.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources

- Blueberries  
- Carrot sticks  
- Apple slices (seedless)  
- Commercial dog treats
