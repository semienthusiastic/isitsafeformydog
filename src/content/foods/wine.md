## Is Wine Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary toxicology sources consistently classify **wine as unsafe for dogs**. The primary concern is **alcohol (ethanol)**, which is listed by the ASPCA and Pet Poison Helpline as toxic to dogs.

Wine is discussed alongside other alcoholic beverages in veterinary literature as a common source of alcohol exposure in pets.

## Why Wine Is Dangerous for Dogs

### Main substance of concern

- **Alcohol (ethanol)**, identified by veterinary toxicology organisations as toxic to dogs  

Alcohol affects the nervous system, respiratory system, and cardiovascular function. Veterinary sources note that dogs are significantly more sensitive to alcohol than humans.

### Concentration concerns

Wine contains a measurable concentration of alcohol, making even small quantities a potential poisoning risk. Veterinary sources highlight that toxicity risk increases rapidly due to dogs’ lower body weight and metabolism.

### Product differences

Red, white, rosé, sparkling, and fortified wines are all discussed similarly in veterinary resources because **ethanol content**, rather than grape variety, is the primary concern.

## Signs Reported With Alcohol Exposure in Dogs

Veterinary toxicology sources list the following signs associated with alcohol ingestion:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Lethargy  
- Disorientation  

### More serious signs

- Tremors  
- Difficulty breathing  
- Low body temperature  
- Seizures  
- Collapse  

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Alcohol (ethanol)**, the primary toxic concern  
- ⚠️ **Added sugars or flavourings**, present in some wines, which do not reduce alcohol risk  

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary sources note that **puppies and smaller dogs are at greater risk** of alcohol poisoning due to lower body weight. However, alcohol is toxic to dogs of all ages.

## Other Common Alcoholic Beverage Variants

### Beer and spirits

Veterinary articles classify beer and distilled spirits as unsafe due to alcohol content, with spirits posing a higher risk due to concentration.

### Cooking wine

Cooking wines are discussed similarly to drinking wine, as alcohol content remains a concern.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Care Sources

- Plain water  
- Moisture from balanced commercial dog foods  
- Veterinary-formulated hydration products
