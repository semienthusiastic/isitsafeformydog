# EXTREME DANGER
Xylitol (often labeled as **Birch Sugar**) is one of the most dangerous substances for dogs. It is found in sugar-free gum, candy, toothpaste, and some peanut butters.

## Why is it so bad?
In dogs, Xylitol stimulates a massive release of insulin from the pancreas. This causes a rapid, life-threatening drop in blood sugar (hypoglycemia). It can also destroy the liver tissue.

## Symptoms (Can occur in 15-30 mins)
* Vomiting
* Loss of coordination (stumbling)
* Collapse
* Seizures

**If you suspect Xylitol ingestion, run (don't walk) to the vet.**
