## Is Xylitol Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary organisations, including the ASPCA and Pet Poison Helpline, classify **xylitol as extremely toxic to dogs**. Xylitol triggers a rapid release of insulin in dogs, leading to a severe drop in blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).

## Why Xylitol Can Be a Problem for Some Dogs

### Main compounds of concern
- **Xylitol**, a sugar alcohol that causes:
  - A rapid insulin surge in dogs  
  - Dangerous hypoglycaemia  
  - Potential liver injury or liver failure  

### Portion size and dog size
Even extremely small amounts can cause serious toxicity. Smaller dogs are at even higher risk because a tiny dose can have a large effect relative to body weight.

### Preparation differences
Xylitol appears in many products, including:
- Sugar-free chewing gum  
- Sugar-free peanut butter  
- Baked goods  
- Mints and candies  
- Toothpaste and mouthwash  
- Some vitamins or supplements  

Veterinary organisations emphasise that **all forms containing xylitol are unsafe** for dogs.

## Signs Reported When Dogs React Poorly to Xylitol

- Vomiting  
- Weakness  
- Loss of coordination  

### More serious signs
- Tremors  
- Seizures  
- Collapse  
- Liver injury indicators, as noted in veterinary toxicology summaries  

These signs develop quickly and may progress without prompt veterinary care.

## Ingredients or Additives to Watch For

- ❌ **Sugar-free gum or mints**  
- ❌ **Sugar-free or “diet” peanut butter**  
- ❌ **Toothpaste, mouthwash, or sugar-free supplements**  
- ⚠️ **Any product labelled as containing “xylitol,” “birch sugar,” or “wood sugar”**

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Xylitol is toxic to **dogs of all ages**, including puppies. Because of their size, puppies may experience severe effects from even smaller exposures.

## Other Common Variants of Xylitol

### Birch Sugar
Another name for xylitol; equally toxic.

### Sugar-Free Products
Many “low calorie” or “low carb” foods contain xylitol and are unsafe for dogs.

## Dog-Friendly Alternatives Mentioned in Pet-Nutrition Sources
