# Extremely Dangerous
Xylitol (often labeled as **Birch Sugar**) is a sugar substitute found in sugar-free gum, candies, toothpaste, and some peanut butters. 

## Why is it dangerous?
In dogs, Xylitol is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and triggers a potent release of insulin from the pancreas. This causes a rapid, life-threatening drop in blood sugar (**hypoglycemia**).

## Symptoms
Symptoms can occur within 15-30 minutes:
* Vomiting
* Weakness and staggering (loss of coordination)
* Collapse / Seizures
* Liver failure (can occur days later)

**Action:** This is a true emergency. If you suspect your dog ate Xylitol, do not wait for symptoms. Go to an emergency vet immediately.
