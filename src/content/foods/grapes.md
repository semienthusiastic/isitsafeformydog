# Highly Toxic
Grapes, raisins, sultanas, and currants are extremely dangerous to dogs. The exact toxic substance is unknown, but ingestion can lead to **sudden acute kidney failure**. 

## Why is it dangerous?
* **Unpredictable:** Some dogs can eat grapes without issue, while others may go into kidney failure after eating just one or two. There is no known "safe dose."
* **Raisins are worse:** Because they are dried and concentrated, raisins are even more potent than fresh grapes.

## Symptoms
* Vomiting (often within a few hours)
* Lethargy
* Loss of appetite
* Abdominal pain
* **Decreased urination (sign of kidney shutdown)**

**Action:** Immediate veterinary treatment is critical to protect the kidneys.
