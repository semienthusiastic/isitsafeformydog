## Are Leeks Safe for Dogs?

Veterinary toxicology authorities consistently classify **leeks as toxic to dogs**. Leeks are members of the *Allium* family, which also includes onions, garlic, chives, and shallots.

The ASPCA and Pet Poison Helpline list all *Allium* plants as poisonous to dogs. The AKC specifically includes leeks in its guidance, noting that they pose the same risks as onions and garlic.

Across veterinary references, leeks are not considered safe in any form.

## Why Leeks Are Dangerous for Dogs

### Toxic Allium compounds
Veterinary toxicology sources identify sulfur-containing compounds in *Allium* plants that damage red blood cells in dogs, leading to haemolytic anaemia.

### Effect of cooking or drying
Pet Poison Helpline and the AKC state that **cooking, drying, or chopping does not remove toxicity**. Raw and cooked leeks are treated the same in veterinary guidance.

### Cumulative exposure
Veterinary sources note that repeated small exposures may also result in toxicity over time, not only single large ingestions.

## Signs Reported in Leek Toxicity

Veterinary organisations report the following signs associated with leek ingestion:

- Vomiting  
- Diarrhoea  
- Lethargy  
- Weakness  

### More serious signs
- Pale gums  
- Rapid heart rate  
- Collapse  
- Signs consistent with anaemia  

Symptoms may be delayed and can appear several days after exposure.

## Ingredients or Additives of Particular Concern

Leeks are commonly found in foods that veterinary organisations warn about:

- ❌ **Soups and stews**, where leeks are often cooked into the dish  
- ❌ **Stock and broths**, which may contain leek extracts  
- ❌ **Prepared meals**, where leeks are blended or finely chopped  

Veterinary sources treat all forms as unsafe.

## Puppies vs. Adult Dogs

Veterinary toxicology sources state that **leek toxicity affects dogs of all ages**. Puppies may be more vulnerable due to smaller body size, but adult dogs are also at risk.

## Other Allium Vegetables Classified as Toxic

### Onions
Toxic in all forms, including raw, cooked, and powdered.

### Garlic
Listed as toxic due to similar sulfur-containing compounds.

### Chives and shallots
Also classified as unsafe for dogs.

## Allium Plants Listed as Toxic

Veterinary and pet-safety organisations consistently include:

- Leeks  
- Onions  
- Garlic  
- Chives  
- Shallots  

All are classified as toxic to dogs.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

> *This FAQ summarises themes appearing in veterinary toxicology and pet-safety resources.  
> It is informational only and not a substitute for professional veterinary care.*

### Are leeks different from onions?
Veterinary sources state that leeks are part of the same plant family and pose the same toxic risk.

### Does cooking leeks make them safe?
Veterinary organisations confirm that cooking does not reduce Allium toxicity.

### Can small amounts still be harmful?
Pet Poison Helpline notes that both single exposures and repeated small amounts can cause poisoning.
